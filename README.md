# DevOps Playground Repo

I've created this repository to try out multiple DevOps tools at once such as CircleCI, Kubernetes (Azure's AKS), Terraform, Docker, etc.

The idea is to deploy both the infrastructure and the code of a test application to the Cloud using entirely Source Control (git).

The application is a COVID tracking tool that was the practical assignment for a University course named "Advanced Software Building Techniques".

Terraform state is kept in a separate Azure Storage Account.
